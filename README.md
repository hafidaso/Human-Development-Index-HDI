# Human-Development-Index-HDI-
The Human Development Index is a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development. - Wik

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset from the World Bank, focusing on various global development indicators such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, and internet usage. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the relationships between economic factors and health outcomes across different income groups and regions.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the World Bank and includes indicators such as birth and death rates, electric power consumption, GDP, internet usage, infant mortality rate, life expectancy, population density, and unemployment rates.

## Key Findings
- Higher income groups have significantly higher average GDP per capita.
- Life expectancy has generally increased over time across all income groups.
- There is a positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy.
- Economic conditions are closely linked to health outcomes, with wealthier countries having better health indicators.

## Visualizations
The project includes the following visualizations:
- Bar chart of average GDP per capita by income group.
- Line chart of life expectancy over time by income group.
- Scatter plot of GDP per capita vs life expectancy.
- Box plot of life expectancy by income group (not generated due to an error).
- Heatmap of correlation between various World Bank indicators.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python for data analysis and visualization.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations.
